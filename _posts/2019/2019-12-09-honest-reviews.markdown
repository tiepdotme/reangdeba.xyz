Sup, guys?

This article is an attempt to give honest reviews on courses that I've taken at IIT Kanpur. Just because the article has the word "honest" in it, I will also add the grade I got in each course.

**no one.**  
**absolutely no one.**  
**not a soul.**  
**not even an alien.**   
**Me:** Everything in this post is from my personal viewpoint and probably biased. It is NOT endorsed by my university or anyone. This list and reviews will be updated as I have more time.

**If you are a non-IITK student.** The course's instructor(s) can change from semester to semester. Also, not all the courses are have the same grading policy. Yeah, you guessed it -- grading policy is also very much professor dependent. You can read the gory details [here](https://iitk.ac.in/doaa/data/Course-Template-B.Tech-BS.pdf) and [here](https://www.iitk.ac.in/doaa/data/UG-Manual.pdf).

### Semester 1
---
**TA101A: ENGINEERING GRAPHICS** -- After the JoSAA counselling was over, I was offered "B.Tech in Electrical Engineering" at IIT Kanpur. I came here feeling happy about the prospect of learning new state-of-the-art methods and findings. I also thought back then that you got to learn what the name of the degree said i.e., I had this naive notion that I was going to learn about electronics and inner workings of gadgets in college. Little did I know engineering drawing was going to be one of the courses that I was expected to do. In other words, the course is an Institute Core (IC). You have no choice but to do it. I personally don't understand why we are made to do the course. It makes sense to teach it to students of the department where it is used later on -- like ME. But, teaching it to BS Physics students makes no sense. I guess it is just kept in the curriculum because it was taught in the beginning and they just decided, "hey! since the previous generation guys had to do it, why not keep it?" But whatever, the course felt like a waste of my academic fees. I got so frustrated at one point of time I contemplated dropping out of college. :grin: I got a B in the course. I don't even remember what was in the course except for the night I did not sleep before the end semester exam because I thought I'll fail the course. The only recollection of this course -- the kind and humble professor, and the memories of carrying around that drafter in that blue pouch like a retard. It's an easy course to get an A though if you completed the drawings on time and remember how to reproduce them in exams.

**PHY101A: PHYSICS LABORATORY** -- This course was one of the best I'd say in terms of getting to try new stuff hands on. The lab experiments were designed and meaningful. Oh, that cycle wheel looks cool while rotating. The TAs can be a pain sometimes. In particular, I remember an instance where one wanted me to calculate results up to 5 decimal places for some strange reason. It is okay if you ask someone to do what they are required to do, but don't you think you could tell them that in the beginning of the experiment? Asking someone to repeat the work only because someone wrote 0.01, instead of 0.01232 makes no sense. Yeah, you must be like no, there are some things in this universe which requires precision. Well, no the experiment did not require that level of precision. Why? The guys on others days were let go even with one decimal place accuracy. Get some life man, whoever that TA was. :smile: Oh, I got a B in the course. I scored 17/20 in the end term. A grade was given at 18/20.

**MTH101A: MATHEMATICS I** -- This is where life can start becoming daunting, especially after getting so accustomed to getting number based (mostly) answers in JEE. The course involves reasoning based approach to solving problems. Paired with unintelligible accent and handwriting of the professor, the course might feel like living in hell. L20 will never be the same after this. Of course, people do get A's and A*'s despite of everything. To them -- you have my respect man, you really do! Big fan. But, you got to realise one size does not fit all. The course was taught by two professors. The second professor was quite helpful. In a way, he helped me pass the course. The first instructor did not help me when I went to his office. I don't know why they brag about the fact that students can walk into the office if they require help. This was an exception instead he redirected me to someone else who was not supposed to know what he taught in the class. Much, wow. I got a D, mainly because of the second professor who was kind enough to teach me things during office hours.

**LIF101A: INTRODUCTION TO BIOLOGY** -- I did not take biology in high school. But, this course rekindled my interest in biology. One professor had cool t-shirts and the older professor had understandable accent (an exceptional quality if you observe other professors). I got a B in the course. The course touches on basic biology, no reproduction not included. You should ideally get a B or higher if you wish to do future BSE courses. I studied much of the material on Khan Academy. Thanks, Sal.

**PHY102A: PHYSICS-I** -- Not for kids. But, you gotta do it anyways because this is an IC course. The first few weeks may seem like basic mechanics from your entrance exam prep, but after that you can have a bumpy ride. I had. Got a D in the course. Don't be like me. You can read more about it [here](/2019/11/23/lookback/). The professor's hand waves were nice to look at. L20 light can be sleep inducing. The board work depends on the professor really. From what I'm told if you solve the problem sets on time and crush the end semester exam, you are at a good spot. I did none.

**PHI141A: INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY** -- This course was allotted to me via a lottery. Did not have much choice but to do the course. The instructor was phenomenal -- the teaching skills and speaking skills were amazing. He also had this cute little 'post-its' so that he did not miss any important point in class. I got a B in the course. You may get annoying classmates, though. We argued if a table is really table or an essence of a table for about two weeks. I felt like kicking out the person out of the class, but you see the world wants you to be kind and polite. So, he ended up not being kicked out. I mean it's one thing to initiate a conversation and have a dialog. But, when you start flexing your dumb thoughts and prevent other people from having constructive dialog you are up for being kicked out, seriously! You know that annoying aunty in group chats, right?

**PE101A: MORNING EXERCISE** -- No comments on this one. My only suggestion would be that you should make it on time, even if it means staying up all night for attending the class. I got an S.

### Semester 2
---
**PHY103A: PHYSICS-II** -- Again, not for the weak-hearted. It definitely wasn't for me. I did not have much of relationship with Physics even in school except that I studied what was important for tests. I did not take up BS in IISc Bangalore for this reason. But, more on that later. I got a D. The text book is nice. I got whatever marks I got in this course from reading the book. The instructors were particularly awesome. For the second time at IITK I appreciated the professors ways of teaching.

**CHM102A: GENERAL CHEMISTRY** -- The course has very basic stuff, the ones that you mostly know from your JEE prep. I got a B. Yeah, I know right I screwed up. If there is one thing that I learnt at IITK, it is to not screw up the endterm examinations. You can have a really rough ride if you do so. The professors were cool.

**ESC101A: FUNDAMENTAL OF COMPUTING** -- I got a B and because of that I did not get ESO207A aka DS or in simpler words Data Structures and Algorithms. The course has almost a fixed syllabus. Puru taught the last few lectures, his PowerPoint skill is awesome. A bit of Python was also introduced by Prof. Swaprava Nath, the fonts he used were cool looking. I did miserably in the final lab exam. Other than that almost every other test of the course went pretty okay. The slides were helpful, in fact the best resource to get marks in the course. This course really got me interested in Computer Science in general. An interest that I still pursue to this day and because of which my grades just flew by. :tada:

**CHM101A: CHEMISTRY LABORATORY** -- Looking the color change from violet to pink will make you feel like a scientist. You will also spend minutes if not hours under the bright sunshine and get your hands dirty trying to expose a certain thing to the sun. I got an A -- my first A, as you may have noticed. Not bad, huh. It is one of the pre-requisites to get that stamped piece of paper they call a 'degree' at the end of your time here at IITK.

**PE102A: EVENING EXERCISE** -- No comments on this one either. I got an S. I am not a sports person myself, but I played hockey and football. Fun fact: I scored a goal from the penalty spot in one of the football matches.

**MTH102A: MATHEMATICS-II** -- **Copy-paste MTH101A reviews here.**

### Semester 3
---
**EE200A: SIGNALS, SYSTEMS & NETWORKS** -- One of the best taught courses on campus. I got a C. Lecture notes won't be provided and hence you ideally gotta attend all the lectures. MIT OCW would be a life saver. OCW will have your back for most of the courses. Oppenheim is amazing, you will probably spend hours watching his lectures on OCW. The lectures sort of feel like vintage movie clips.

**ESO213A: FUNDAMENTALS OF EARTH SCIENCES** -- I took this since I was 'ineligible' for ESO207A. I got an A. The curriculum was flexible enough me to opt for on 'option'. The professor taught the course well. He seemed enthusiastic about the course so much so that at one point he brought out rocks, limestones and magnifying glasses for the class to see. You should take the course if you don't have anything in particular against ES department.

**MSO202A: COMPLEX VARIABLES** -- I failed the course the first time I took it. I was in the ICU for four days sometime in the middle of the course. Did not drop the course because I thought whatever happens will happen but I am not dropping a course. Fun fact: I haven't dropped any course till now. I couldn't make it, so yeah. This course really hurt my core, you know. But, a nice senior was kind enough to talk to me about it and it started feeling less terrible. You just got to accept the reality at times, you know.

**MSO203B: PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS** -- One of the craziest course, about 100 people dropped the course during that offering. I got a B. I don't remember a thing but may be it's how things are supposed to be.

**ESC201A: INTRODUCTION TO ELECTRONICS** -- The professor nailed the teaching part. I got a C. I am not particularly unhappy about it. I had my reasons. I had fun in the lab part. The only regret is that I did not blow any diode in the lab experiment. I wish I did.

**COM200: COMMUNICATION SKILLS: COMPOSITION** -- This is just there for the graduation requirements, I passed all the required assignments. I got an S. I did not go to a single lecture after the first lecture.

**TA201A: MANUFACTURING PROCESSES I** -- **Copy paste TA202A reviews here**. No difference at all.

### Semester 4
---
**BSE322A: BIOINFORMATICS & COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY** -- The professor is one of the best professors at IITK. The course was an easy one. I got an A. I think the professor won best teaching award this year. He emphasised well on the core material and explained until the students understood. If you have enough credits to take the course I's highly recommend the course. Nothing more to say here.

**EE250A: CONTROL SYSTEMS ANALYSIS** -- I got a B. The course was an easy one. The professor used an iPad for writing lecture notes which was pretty impressive. He did put in effort from his end. The course had marks for 'EI' or as he likes to call it 'Extraordinary Insights'. But, I guess at the end the marks for 'EI' were given away based on attendance. You'll learn how to write in a small space after taking this course. 'Extra sheets people' are going to have a tough time.

**EE210A: MICROELECTRONICS-I** -- One of the worst taught course ever. The professor himself admitted that he did a bad job teaching the course at the end of the term. I thought I'll fail the course but ended up getting a C. That's what people would call a 'miracle'. People got A grade at >= 48%. I don't remember anything from the course except suggesting to the professor that rich people are still going to buy iPad Pro despite its high price tag.

**MSO201A: PROBABILITY AND STATISTICS** -- Some would say the professor is one of the kindest because he did not give anyone a D. Some would say the course is easy, or in popular parlance-- 'chill'. But, he wasn't neither kind to me nor did the course seem 'chill' to me. I got a D, yes at 50%. He decided for some reason to give D to people with 0-50% marks! Wow. The course deals with basic probability and statistics stuff except that I did not study well for the tests. Also the tutor for the tutorials was boring. He seemed as if he did not have life inside him.

**ESO203A: INTRODUCTION TO ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING** -- I knew the grade I was going to get in the class the day I walked into the first class. The way the professor spoke made me certain that ours was certainly not a good match. I ended up getting a C, yay! Nothing made sense to me. I think this was the point I started disliking and neglecting my courses altogether. I am certain now that Electrical Engineering just isn't for me. Hence, after 7th semester I'm going to say bye to EE and switch fields. The class had compulsory attendance, hence I attended all the lectures. But, the lectures got so boring after a certain point I started reading [CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) notes during the class. I wrote the exams only because I was required to take them. It felt as if all my enthusiasm about learning died after doing the course.

**TA202A: MANUFACTURING PROCESSES II** -- I don't understand why this is in the curriculum. I guess they just put it because the old machines were lying there unused. I got a B.

### Summer 2019
---
**MSO202A: COMPLEX VARIABLES** -- I got a C this time. I wasn't sick or anything. This is when I realised reasoning based math isn't for me. I tried my best to wrap my head around the concepts but it just seemed impossible. I'm happy that all the required math courses for graduation are met by this point.

**PSY499A: PSYCHOLOGY OF LANGUAGE** -- I got an A. This is one of the best course I've taken on campus in terms of the content and the rigour of discussions. The professor went through each and every viewpoint and let the class have a meaningful discussion while not getting too much deviated from the main points. This is when I realised, I could write okay sort of thing. The professor told me that I had scored the highest in a written test and that it was one of the best writings in terms of the flow of thoughts and the arguments presented. I might probably end up doing an advanced version of the course.

### Semester 5
---
**EE320A: PRINCIPLES OF COMMUNICATION** -- Have you met a robot in real life? I did. I remember the first class -- walking into the class at 8 AM in the morning I was excited to learn about stuff, you know since I had done so badly in life so far. The professor just came in and started writing on the board. No introduction, no saying why we must be studying the course, nothing! Just bare mathematical equations. If you want to learn how to speak without opening your mouth you should take this course. Well, for EE guys it is compulsory to take the course. The course also used a thing called 'Acadly', god knows why! The quizzes were held on the app and you got 50% marks if you only ticked one option, regardless of whether you had any knowledge of the course. All you gotta do is tick one option before submitting. Also, if you use a low-end phone or your phone is unable to connect to the Wi-Fi then god save you. I remember this one time asking the instructor about the Wi-Fi connection problem, he just stared at the screen and gave it back! Stone cold, nothing. Robot in real life. I got a C. I did not even think I'll pass the course. But, whatever I'll just graduate by the 7th semester and get out of this place. The institute should retire such professors. I do understand that they might be excellent at research, so let them do research. I at least expect a decent teacher to teach me stuff I don't know. Is that too much to ask? Is this how you're gonna jump the rankings and be in the Top 10? Wow! Much, wow.

**EE330A: POWER SYSTEMS** -- Pretty boring course, but since you are in EE you gotta do the course. I'd say it's largely my fault that I got a C in the course. I was not serious enough and was working on many things simultaneously. The course is an easy one. Not much material, you just gotta solve the problem sets. I am impressed by the instructor's efforts. He tried to really get his point across to the students and I respect that. The course is inherently boring, nothing much he could do about and nothing much I could do either. Hence, the phenomenal grade.

**EE370A: DIGITAL ELECTRONICS** -- The professor had excellent teaching skills. The course had the right amount of content. Course notes were not provided, but since the lectures were from 11 AM you could get all the notes. Board work was okay, might have been tough for people at the back. It kind of looks at how a computer is built at the logic block level. I got a C in the course. I honestly don't know how. I was expecting a D or an F. Surprises in life, LOL. :joy:

**EE380A: ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING LAB I** -- No idea how I managed to get an A in this course. I did all the experiments and submitted the reports on time. The midterms were terrible, but they only accounted for 10% of the final grade. I got lucky in the endterm in that I got to do the one experiment that I knew really well. Thanks, lady luck! I got 23/25 in the end term.

**EE390A: ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING COMMUNICATION SKILLS** -- Nothing to say much here except that my LaTeX skills got enhanced. We were required to pass 10 assignments out of 13. 2 out of the 10 were compulsory meaning you had to pass those 2 no matter what. So, that makes 2 compulsory + 8 out of the rest 11 assignments that you were **required** to get an S grade. No endterm. We were required to write a tutorial paper and typeset it in LaTeX with the plagiarism count to be kept <= 24%. Mine was 15%. For reference [here](/assets/docs/EE390A_2019_Tutorial__Generative_Adversarial_Networks__GANs_final.pdf) is the paper I wrote. The course seemed like a formality rather, but since it is DC you gotta do it.

**EE698V: MACHINE LEARNING FOR SIGNAL PROCESSING** -- The course promised to look at SOTA practices and focus on practical approach rather than a theoretical approach. I don't think any of the promises were kept. We ended up looking at two papers from like a decade old. And the course got very much theoretical. The course was so hyped that L2 was filled with people during the first lecture, but eventually only about 100 people were left. I think if you attach Machine Learning to whatever XYZ course at IITK, your course will most likely get over-subscribed to. This was the first offering of the course and I think the instructor tried his best. He even posted the lecture videos and audio recordings which is rare at IITK. I respect him for that. The final grading was very lenient. I got a B in the course.

**EE392A: UNDER GRADUATE PROJECT II** -- I got a B. I don't know what I did to deserve that grade. I worked on the project most of the semester, only to realise at the end that the dataset I was using was the wrong one. So, I worked on lattice generation using machine learning, which is a fancy to say about creating new matrices from the existing ones with the requirement that the new lattices follow a certain probability distribution and the energy, magnetisations etc. matched with that of the training data. It was an oversight on my part as well. There are two popular models used to study the magnetism of lattices: the XY model and the Ising model. I was working on the Ising model using data for the XY model, duh! I did tell the people involved explicitly that I'm working on the Ising model, but the starter code they gave me was of XY model. Also, my emails were not replied to and hence I kind of started losing touch with the advisor. During the final evaluation I was told that I did not meet enough. :cry: Whatever, this was a bad experience, I only pray that I have better experiences in the future.

**That's it for now. Catch you guys in the next one, peace. :v:**

Good luck! Let me know your thoughts in the comments. Also, can we still stay friends now that you know everything? :smile:
