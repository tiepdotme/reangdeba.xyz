So the endterm is <s>almost</s> over. I just realised that I've been doing everything wrong until this morning. I should have worked on the things at hand, rather than eyeing for things that are ahead. An example of this is me working on various online coursework for certificates and fun, rather than studying for the required courses. It is too late now to improve my grades this semester, I guess I will still have to live with six-point-something. If I do not get a summer internship abroad (which is highly unlikely as it stands), I'll stay back during the summer and do 18 credits of coursework. Preferably an undergraduate project under Prof. Preeti Malakar and a Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) Level 2 course. This would mean that I shall complete my degree by the seventh semester.

I plan on working as a research assistant in my 8th semester with a Professor and publish our findings at a major conference. I do not know what the long term implications of this would be, but I just realised if I don't graduate with good grades no university will admit me as a grad student. I currently don't have good grades as such. But, I still have three (or may be two) terms of college left and can certainly still make a mark, if I keep my distractions low. So, I will try as much as I can to improve my grades. In the best case I can graduate with a CPI of around 7.9 by the end of my degree. I'll think about converting to Dual Degree if things don't stay as planned. But, more on that later.

As a first step to focussing on things at hand I am going to complete the three projects that I've been working on, instead of taking up too many things on my plate. So, this December I will do the following:

* [ ] Complete the Summer Project that I'd taken under Prof. Preeti Malakar -- I've been putting off this one way too much. Thanks to the mentor, she did not say anything as such until now and agreed to everything I could ever ask for like more days, more time for studying. I wish I find more advisors like her in the future. I plan on finishing the project and starting something fresh by the end of December. The plan is to finish the summer project by the end of November and ask if I can attend the High Performance Computing Winter School 2019 (which I really wish to). If selected, I plan to do that one very seriously as well.
* [ ] Complete the recommender system for treadwill.org under Prof. Nitin Gupta -- To be honest this should have taken me only about a week to implement, but I've been putting this off as well. Hence, I'll start working on this seriously from November 28 and finish within a week.
* [ ] Work on the project that I started under Prof. Vipul Arora -- Since this project is open ended, I plan on getting as much done as possible by the end of December. I'll maintain more communication with him, so that he cannot say I did not maintain contact like he said previously.

I have six courses next semester. And I plan on doing them very well instead of working on too many things. I will only do coursework next semester, instead of undertaking any projects. I think the professors will allow me to come and work for them if I do a good job this December.
