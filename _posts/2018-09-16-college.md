Just a little bit of background about my college life.

Last weekend, as I was sipping through my cup of coffee after an "intense" study-session, the thought of writing about my college life struck my mind. So here we are &ndash;

> I hope I don't bore you much and that you love what you read.

I always held this view that one must complete formal education unless except some extraordinary situation forces otherwise.

I finished my high school in April 2017 from NPS International School Guwahati. After that, I joined the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur.
Well, many incidences happened between leaving high school and joining college, but I'll keep that for another time.

I decided to major in Electrical Engineering, mainly because my rank allowed me to do that and also among all the available options, EE at IITK seemed the best one for me.
I have to say that I do not at all regret my decision.

> I also got selected for admission in IISc Bangaluru, but I did not join.

<p>Here are few images of Freshman Year that I posted on Facebook.<p>
