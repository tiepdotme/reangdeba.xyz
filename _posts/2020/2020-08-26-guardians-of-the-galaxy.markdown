"You Done F**ked Up"

That’s what Trevor said. I think it accurately captures the feelings of many after the event. Significantly, the sentiments of the honourable Students’ Senate. Heads up, this article is going to be a series of rants about why scrapping the final results of Galaxy 2020 makes little sense. However, I must commend the efforts put in by everyone to conclude. I’ve not seen/heard of anything as such in my short time at IITK, but hey, it’s 2020.

As a disclaimer, this article is prone to being heavily biased, and at some point you, the reader might question the logic behind the writing. As I said, it’s going to be a series of rants and not a definitive “court-judgement” that takes every little thing into account. If “political correctness” is what you’re looking for, you should stop reading now! With the disclaimer out of the way, let’s continue.

Naturally, the question arises, "Why do you care so much about the results?" For starters, I am one of the members of the winning pool. I stayed up nights after nights and organized a competition (which also got scrapped). Hell, Galaxy 2020 was why my ex-girlfriend and I broke up! You don’t scrap the results of the Olympic Games just because one athlete got caught doping. There are two parties in this – The winning pool, and everyone else. "Ek hai jeetne wale, aur baaki sab saala Ramadhir ke aadmi."

Ask anyone in the winning pool, and they’ll tell you how unjust scrapping the results was despite everything. The other party will tell you how it is justified, and that they must set an example. We must hold ourselves to the highest moral standards, and such cannot tolerate indiscipline and indecency. Both parties are correct in their own right. However, it’s also important to note that at some point during their time at IITK, everyone cheered against other pools and thought that theirs was the best at everything.


### A few words on Galaxy as a competition

#### Pros
* First-year students get a chance to explore and take part in the cultural aspect of the campus.
* It fosters a sense of bonding between the seniors and juniors. Of course, the opposite is also true.
* It gives the pools something to feel happy about themselves. Can you imagine someone going around the campus saying they have `xyz`s number of 10-pointers?
* It instils lawyerly feeling among the sophomores, who are in charge of organizing most things. I’m sure you’re well aware of the pool meetings where they exploit every loophole in the rulebook. It surprises me that none of the pools objects during the discussions for formulating rules.
* It gives you a sense of belonging, and more importantly acts as an excuse to take a break from the monotonous/arduous day-to-day work.

#### Cons
* Galaxy can lead to heartbreaks.
* Many ends up screwing up their academics, and a few never recover from it.  One can say, "they were going to do badly anyway." That may be true, but who are you to decide that for them.
* Many students get more concerned with exploiting the rules and completely disregard fair-play. One would do any $N$ number of things and make $X$ number of arguments to get an event scrapped.
* Friendships might suffer because of fierce competition. People can get physical like savages and completely ignore Gandhian values. Of course, everything gets fixed over *chai-sutta*.

I think the Senate's decision was a bit of an over-reaction. Sure, many acts of indecency and cheating were rampant throughout the competition, but you had the entire conducting body to ensure that the battles are as fair as possible. Instead of scrapping results after an event takes place, take care to prevent fraud and indecency in the first place.
You don't cancel an entire Football League just because a player got served Red card. You ban the individual/the team for a few matches or a full season.

I acknowledge that a sense of morality and being "just" runs through the body; however, that sense must be upheld tenure-to-tenure and not be a one-time thing. There are multiple instances where it has failed to intervene. Taking these into account, I don’t think the decision was entirely justified.

**Endnote.** I do not mean to disrespect anyone, living or dead, irrespective of peoples' affiliation to the Students' Senate. I don’t wish to attract harsh sentences for saying all that I said. Given the things that go around, I’m not even surprised. Well, thanks for reading. Stay safe and hope that your pool wins the next edition of the competition. I must, however, warn you that many things will end up getting scrapped. Just hope the final result stands. Peace!
