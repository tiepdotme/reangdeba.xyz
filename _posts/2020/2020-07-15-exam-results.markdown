Hiya!

**Disclaimer:** I got 84% in grade 10 & 95.6% in grade 12 final exams. I'm only 21, so don't consider this a life advice.

If you recently got your board exam results i want to say something to you. the results does matter but not as much as you think. Let me explain. I won't go to the extend of saying that it does not matter at all, considering I did considerably okay in the exams.

Here's how the results do matter --

* Class 10 results will determine where you spend the next 2 years (11 & 12) before college (if you choose to attend one). So, it matters a little, but not a lot.
* If you're like me -- considering moving to a different state for better education, the school boards might be different and the school has nothing else but your marks to judge you (sadly).
* In cases like these, the marks do matter somehow. someone coming from a CBSE school might have 10/10. I stood 4th or 5th overall in Dhalai (a small district in Tripura), but why would Assam school care much about that? I still got 84% right? It's funny how we don't have a nationwide standardised exam, but more on that some other time.
* Good grades in class 10 could help you pay for your 11 & 12 education. This doesn't matter if your parents or you are uber rich.
* IITs (more specifically JoSAA) requires that you have >= 75% marks or top 20% overall in grade 12 final exam (something like that). This is also absurd, lol. Anything lesser than that means that you don't meet the eligibilty criteria for the colleges even if you do well in the entrance test, you're screwed.
* Some govt. offices might show you some respect while you go to get your documents (a few of them actually) now that you're 18 or more (some of you might still be kids, i get it!) after looking your gradesheet. (this happened to me, they processed the docs within a day and issued it the next day).
* Naila aunty will probably offer you sweets when you visit her if you have good grades. People will gossip about you in your dynasty and the locality. Some newspapers might even publish your photo. Although, teenage photos are mostly gross anyway. Puberty rocks, man!

Here's how your results don't matter --

* None will actually care much about your marks as you move up the age ladder, by the time you land up somewhere like the IITs, almost everyone around you will have good grades.
* You can choose to skip college totally, if there's is something better to do. None will even ask you for it except occassionally, just to see if you're a legit human being.
* Class 10 marksheet will become more like birth certificate and would be used mostly to confirm that your parents' names are what you say they are.
* You'll probably store away class 12 gradesheet as `XII_Marksheet.pdf` and look at it only when you're required to prove your identity. Think of it as another identity document. Or you can look at it when you're happy to be sad and vice-versa.
* Your parents will still love you the same regardless of how much you scored. If you don't have younger siblings, you're cool.
* If you got younger siblings, you might get casual stares later on, assuming they score better than you. Otherwise, chill out! I'm not asking you to intentionally prevent your younger sibling(s) from scoring high, you moron!
* You'll still have to struggle whether you scored high or low. You can end up smoking up weed by the time you get to third or fourth year no matter what you scored. It's okay, as long as you don't die. Life sucks, lmao.
* Being a human being means you'll have to bear sufferings. Human life is suffering, period! Everyone has chances of dying of a deadly virus whether they did well in their exams or not. So, calm the fuck down!
* You can earn your own money and buy the damn sweets. Screw Naila aunty!

If you don't work (regardless of what you did in exams), you'll have a hard time. If you don't want to die, you gotta work. If you don't want to work then you'll prolly die. Even your death doesn't matter xD. Many more babies are on their way to the Earth the second you die, so chill out bruh!

<reddot>Congrats!</reddot> on graduating successfully. One exam doesn't define you. But you shouldn't screw up just because of that.
