Hi, friend!

I hope you are safe. Before getting into anything else -- Wash your hand, try to stay at home, and take care of the elderly.

It is 5 AM, and I know I should be asleep. But, I am not. Instead, I gulped down a cup of milk-tea that tasted bland while thinking about how can I raise a little more fund to buy rice, salt, dry-fish, soaps, and potatoes for the families that have not been getting their daily bread because of the global pandemic and the subsequent lockdown. We really were not ready to face this pandemic and I doubt we are ready for the next one. Since I am not an expert on the subject matter I won't dwell upon that so much. But, I am aware of my existence and the people around me. I am well aware of the fact that many families in my community are facing hardships because they lost their daily means of livelihood.

I won't blame any particular organization or establishment for anything. This is not the time to be shifting blames from one to the other. As unfortunate as it sounds, many families in my community live on a day-to-day basis meaning whether or not they'll get their supper is based on their earnings from day labour. This might come as a surprise to many of you reading this article but that's the truth. Many families earn a living by selling vegetables that they procured from the jungle or by selling firewood. With the lockdown in place they lost their daily source of income. State govt. of Tripura recently announced that they would [provide free ration to 6.19 lakh families for one month](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/tripura-to-provide-free-ration-to-6-19-lakh-poor-families-for-one-month/articleshow/74927726.cms). That is a great move by the govt. But, the problem is that many families don't have a ration card or job card. Hence, they won't qualify for the rationing scheme rolled out by the govt. I don't know how they got left out from BPL (Below Poverty Line) ration quotas. I'll rant about that another day. The point being -- many families simply exist without these cards and other documentation required to receive rationing and other services from the govt. However, you see we cannot let them starve to death just because they were not enrolled in the rationing scheme or that they don't have a job card.

[Silver Plate](https://instagram.com/silverplate_) aims to help these families in small ways -- buying rice for a week or so until these families are issued temporary ration cards, buy toiletries like soaps, salt, a few kilos of potatoes etc. It is not much, but it would help them sustain until some alternate arrangements are made. So far, I have been able to raise a little over â‚¹12,000 with much help from family and friends and some personal savings. To me no amount is small nor should anyone be denied life just because they missed out on a few schemes. I estimate that I should be able to help about 20 or so families with the funds collected so far. I am hopeful that many more people would contribute in the coming days.

I urge you to donate a small sum so that no family has to go to bed hungry. I wish to thank everyone who has donated selflessly thus far. The fight for survival must go on. **Together we can!**

In case of any queries please feel free to reach out to me. I appreciate your time and love. Thank you!
