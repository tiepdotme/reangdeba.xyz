**Hello World!**

**Coming soon...**

<!-- Introducing the readers to your writings with three vague words isn't the best strategy to capture their attention but I shall try my best to do justice to your valuable time.

I decided that I'd share my thoughts with other people, well quite the few, on various issues that I may find or found interesting. I hope that we have meaningful discussions on my views on certain topics. The main motive behind writing these articles is to capture your attention and make you aware of the topics you may otherwise be unfamiliar with.

Here's an interesting picture to capture your interest:

I captured that, one morning during the course of bicycle trip to Bithoor. Beautiful isn't it?
Kanpur as a city may not be green and beautiful but the mornings here and the people are amazing. Only, few times did I feel I was away from home.

Back home, at this time of the year, I would most probably be out to 'Puja' shopping with mom. The weather during these months is really awesome, neither rainy nor cold or hot. You feel sleepy if you're home or homesick if you're away. Hey! you don't get everything in life, simultaneously, do you? Afterall, the world isn't a wish granting factory.

But life is going great. I am grateful to the people in my life and this life. **Welcome!** I hope you had a good reading time. -->
