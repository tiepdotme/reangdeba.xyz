# reang's blog

Finally! I think I found the best of both worlds (cool homepage and blog template), after years of modifying CSS and Jekyll templates. Thanks to [Jon Barron](https://jonbarron.info) for the homepage and [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.github.io) for the blog.

Feel free to adapt and mix my site's layout in your own way.
