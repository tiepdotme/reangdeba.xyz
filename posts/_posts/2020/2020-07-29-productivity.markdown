***Disclaimer:** Before you read any further, it is important to warn you about everything I'm going to say henceforth. The title aptly says these tips are "for people exactly like me." I don't think anyone is exactly like me, hence take everything I say with a cup of coffee. You might ask, "Well, why did you write the article then?" My answer to that would be, "Why are you reading the article?"*

Okay, disclaimers are boring. Let's get into the important stuff.

It is important to have a proper sense of time for us to be able to work effectively. The global pandemic forced all of us to undertake unprecedented measures including working from home, collaborating over group texts among other things. Moreover, I don't find the home environment very conducive to work. I prefer a cafe or the library to get important stuff done. However, I'm bound by the situation. I cannot do anything to change the current way of things.

This article is a result of a 90+ days of experimentation on the best practices to get work done. While, I'm not completely satisfied with the end result, I think it's good progress. Of course, I'm working to develop a more efficient system for myself, but we have something to work with here.

To sum up everything in a line -- Eliminate distractions and get the best out of yourself.

While that advice sounds straightforward and almost naive, it is really hard to impose that on yourself. Moreover, we don't exactly know what those distractions are. Some interruptions are hard to be classified as distractions, while others are straightforward to classify. As an example take your mobile phone notifications, that's clearly a distraction. How about your mum calling you for lunch? That's not very easy to classify, is it? There are countless other situations where you don't know what's distracting you.

A way around this problem is to fix a routine.
