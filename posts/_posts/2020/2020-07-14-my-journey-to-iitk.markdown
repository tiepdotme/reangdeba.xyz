My journey to IIT Kanpur has been a unique ride. I was fortunate enough to attend a school which had school-integrated JEE coaching program. All it means is that, in addition to helping you prepare for the competitive exams you also get a taste of high school albeit at a cost. I multiplied lots of matrices, titrated chemicals just for the sake of color change, and managed to do decent enough to get a spot at IIT Kanpur.

Before attending the school for my Class 11 and Class 12, I did not know what IITs were. I vaguely knew engineering was something I wanted to do, but had no concrete idea how to do it. To be honest, I knew about two things only -- you either get into med school or you do engineering. Otherwise, you're a failure. I know that sounds harsh but that's how I was brought up and there was none to tell me otherwise. Studying the arts, and commerce was frowned upon and sometimes regarded a low of academics, just because most people who did not get good enough grades in their exams pursued those fields.

With the vague idea of engineering in mind, I asked my parents if they'd be kind enough to let me study at a school outside my home state and if I could prepare for my engineeing exams. Surprisingly, they allowed me to do that. I'm super grateful to them for letting me do it. They paid for my school fees and I did not end up in debt.

It's been heck of a ride so far. Less than 15 people including me got into IITs in the history of the high school. The number is improving year-by-year, but I'm happy that I was one of them. Honestly, I can't imagine what I would be doing today if it weren't for IITK. I don't like Electrical Engineering, my current major. But, IITK is much more than that. After staying three years there, one thing is clear to me. Even though I don't like EE, and would eventually switch fields, I won't have had the courage to dream of big things if it weren't for IITK. For that I owe my gratitude to IITK.

After getting here, I realised that I'm not that unique either. Most people went through much more difficult circumstances and still made it. The place is filled with awesome people. If there's something that I came to appreciate about the place, it's the diversity of it's students and the faculty. No matter which part of the country you came from, the institute provides a environment for bonding and collaboration.

If you're a prospective student, looking to decide between IITK and other colleges, choose IITK without any hesitation. I can promise you that you won't be disappointed. I still have a year left here. Let's see what the future holds for me. All the best to you too!
