I have always been interested in other people's stories. Partly, because I was brought up that way and partly, because I believe that I can learn a lot from others. The idea of documenting other people's stories came to my mind one morning, at about 4 A.M. as I was working through an assignment in KD Building. The next day I got in touch with a senior asking him about his journey. Personally, I was going through a lot at that time. Hearing him out made me realise that what I was going through was not uncommon for an undergrad.

The first idea was to interview people and then publish the interview. I'm yet to publish anything but I'm hopeful that I'll be able to write a few stories before I leave IIT Kanpur.

Recently, I started a project whose goal is more or less the same -- share other people's stories. However, this one is different from the above, and more of a LinkedIn style presentation of rejections. To understand what I am talking about head to this [link](https://reangdeba.github.io).

### FAQs
**What do you aim to achieve from doing this?**<br>
Honestly, I don't know precisely what the end result would be. But, I can tell you that the primary aim is to start a conversation in the campus. A conversation around the topic of what counts as achievements and what don't. The goal of the project is to get across the message that we are more than what our resumes tell about us. This is however not to say that we should not strive to achieve the highest standards for ourselves. The main goal is to raise awareness more than anything else.
