Hey! I hope you're doing well and that you are keeping yourself and your loved ones safe. Please go out only when it's absolutely necessary and follow proper safety mesaures. You are awesome.

This whole quaratine have taken a toll on my thought process. While I try to keep myself engaged and listen to and read about positive events, I cannot help but notice all the other negativity going around. And then there are the life experiences. Over the course of the day, chances are that a few good and a few bad events will happen. 

I wanted to talk about these things that have been bothering me a lot. I don't have definitive answers to any of these. So, I'll just give a narrative and then pose a few questions. Feel free to get back to me via email or Twitter DMs if you have anything to say on these.

Just to be clear, I love this country and what its people stands for. I don't mean to criticise this great nation and its awesome people in any way. But, I also believe in the Constitution and the idea of democracy. Therefore, I must point out a few things that I think we're doing incorrectly.

There are many wrong thing going on in the country, with its rape, poverty, and everything else. But, the moment you can't get into IIT Bombay CSE, you're like, "That's it, motherfucker! I'll write about you on Facebook." I don't think any of you have any real commitment for progress or upliftment of these marginalized communities. You are just propagating anti-reservation sentiments just so people you see favourably can get ahead. You're just saying, "Let's get rid of reservations because inequity isn't as bad as it used to be."

If you write long posts on Facebook, crying over something that you don't understand even an iota of, and unnecessarily discriminate against people from other sections of the society, you truly are an Indian. You just happen to be the worst kind!
