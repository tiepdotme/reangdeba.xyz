I will graduate from college around this time next year and I am already excited to attend the graduation ceremony and leave the campus for good. For the better or for worse, I've already developed a habit of lamenting over the fact that I could have done so much in these three years! Given my circumstances, I think the current state of me is the best that could have been possible or let's face it, I cannot possibly change what has already occurred. I always think to myself that I could have started companies, met many new people and change the world for the better, not realising that changes don't happen overnight. I've been reflecting a lot these days mainly because of the lockdown and I have nothing much else to do.

### 1. Electrical Engineering

When I was in high school, I just wanted to study engineering. I did not have any idea about which department would be better for me and so on. Like most people my age, I chose my department based on my rank and ended up in Electrical Engineering at IIT Kanpur. I'll be honest with you here, if there is one thing that I know for certain after these three years at IITK, it is that I don't like EE at all. I really don't know for sure what my interests are but I know for a fact that EE isn't something that I'm going to pursue in the future.

People in my school mostly took up Civil Engineering as their major because of the apparently booming real estate market in NE India. While I have nothing against CE guys, I'm really happy that I chose EE over other departments (exclude CSE). I'm convinced that CS is something I want to devote a large chunk of my future time to, so yes I'm happy that I did not choose other departments. I could have been a wise man and chose CSE at IITG or IITKGP, but like I said, I had no idea whatsoever. 

*Additionally,* having majored in EE, I have an idea about what my interest could be going forward. I think I'll pursue something at the intersection of AI and Healthcare. I fell in love with the Life Sciences after coming to IITK, I think I'll try to explore more of the field and hopefully do something with it. As funny as it sounds, I was going over MCAT pre-requisites the other day. Medicine seems out of my reach now. I cannot afford to do another UG degree in medicine, and I don't meet the pre-requisites for med school.

I think majoring in EE helped me to (1) understand how computers work at a fundamental level, (2) Get exposure to machine learning (3) deepen my fascination for Computer Science

### 2. Work & Career

I was pretty hell bent on getting a Ph.D. in any field. I really don't know why I thought that. That is still true to this day — I will get a Ph.D. if nothing abrupt happens in life. During my first year, I was more interested in Physics (Astronomy) than anything else. I had even tried to unsuccessfully apply to a summer internship program. Since, I had no idea I tried my best to figure out my interests by reading reviews and sometimes books on subjects. I remember reading an Astronomy book in my first year and getting really excited about it.

The idea of going for a summer internship abroad or doing an internship at a company was unknown to me then. The aim was to learn as much as I can, get good grades, and grow as a person. I delivered on two of these, I won't tell you which two though. I still am not interning at a company, and I don't think I will. I'm not preparing for final placements either, I will apply to graduate school and see what happens. My parents have been pretty liberal in this regard. They did not tell me what to do and what not to. When I mentioned grad school to them, they were cool about it except they didn't seem very happy about the prospect of me going abroad for two years. We'll see what happens.

The summer after my first year, I went to Guwahati and taught at the high school I graduated from a year ago. It was a fun experience, with no pay. That is also the time I started binge-watching on Netflix. I learnt about power dynamics and how schools functioned. Despite of your ability, there is a structure in place and you are to abide by that. More concretely, even if you know the content you are to just let the senior one hand things for you.

After that I figured out that if I wanted a decent shot at Grad school I should start working towards a research project. So, I emailed a professor in the CSE dept asking for a project. She was kind enough to let me work on it, while others were preparing for their internships. I really did not prepare for it. Consequently, the next semester I started working with another professor on a UGP and did okay on that too. 

That winter I emailed another professor, and he let me work on a coding project which I completed. 

I'm currently working with a professor on Computational Biology, hopefully this would take me somewhere. 

### 3. Women

All throughout my school years, my interaction with girls were limited. I studied at co-ed schools throughout my life but you know I did not interact that much with anyone. I kept to myself and the guy friends. I had a ton of crushes. I just did not tell them. I had crushes on a few which lasted for years. I still am in touch with a few, I just act that I don't care anymore, I mean it would be rude to tell them what is what with their bitch ass boyfriends around.

In grade 11, I asked a girl to meet at the school library before she graduated grade 10 and left the school. She told me I'm boring, lol. Then she left the school.

I had a crush on this girl I first saw in Philosophy class. I mean she had this cute smile, but I never asked her out. 

I asked this girl out for dance, she said "yes!", so we went to the dance. Months later, thus began my first serious relationship. It was devastating in every way, would last for only two months, even internships lasts longer than that. During those months, I only waited for her to be honest, nothing else. One might just dismiss it as a waste of time but I think that relationship taught me a thing or two about relationships and dating in general. After this relationship ended, I went through one of the worst days and nights of my life till date. On the surface, I would smile and wave at everyone I came across, but I was seeing the counsellor and psychiatrist at the same time while surviving on three or four cokes a day. I guess, I went without proper food for about four days or so. The counsellor was nice enough to offer me biscuits and other snacks. The day we broke up, I had an assignment deadline which I missed, but the professor allowed me to submit it late without penalty. I'm really grateful.

My first question was "does it hurt to get dumped?".

After this experience, I continued to ask girls out as sort of a challenge to myself. I asked this girl I met during treasure hunt (she refused, saying she was drunk at a friend's place). I asked another girl, she said she would love to go out on a walk some day, when I reminded she said she won't be able to make it. A friend told me that agreeing for the walk was just an act of politeness, nothing else. 

I asked another girl to meet up. We met up, she's sweet and all. But, she's back with her boyfriend from two years ago, so yes she declined, and we don't talk anymore for no reason.

I asked yet another girl, who I think is beautiful and still have a huge crush on. She agreed to hangout actually. When I suggested to go out for a movie together, she said she's busy and had something to do. I think it was one of the polite moments, but I understand. I still have a huge crush on her. This could have been a really cute date just before the world went into lockdown.

It was scary to ask people out. Each and every rejection hurt. You start doubting yourself and think that your are not good enough. But eventually, you understand that it's okay to ask people out and it doesn't seem odd to do so. You understand that rejections are natural and they will happen. 

My story does not have a happy ending, and I doubt it will have a happy ending but whatever; we'll see what happens.

### 4. People

The college unintentionally forces people to interact with each other. Even if you consider an introvert, more often than not you find yourself surrounded with people who will interact with you and you have to interact with them. Even if you don't wish to interact with anyone you will come across people in labs, classrooms and canteen. This will force you to interact with them, which eventually turn into friendships or academic partnerships.

You are constantly surrounded by one of the best minds of the country all the time. While this can be overwhelming at times, you actually learn a lot from each other. You will be riding bicycles side-by-side calling each other names, and then it turns out that the guy you're talking to was a state topper in his board exams. You yourself are a school topper and so on.

Some of you all must be thinking, well not everyone is a genius. That might be true but ask the same person to edit a video or do a voiceover, your opinion of them will change instantly.

I don't know what is the distribution of intelligence in the campus and how it is distributed — hall-wise or dept-wise or something else, but I'm glad that I've had interactions with all these amazing people.

### 5. Freedom

In school we almost had a fixed routine, you wake up, attend school or coaching classes and then you had study sessions and in rare cases play time in the evenings. But, those hours were fixed for you, either you yourself fixed them or someone else like your school or your parents did that for you. In college you have all these hours that you can spend however you like to. There isn't a fixed routine whatsoever. You can choose to not go out of your hostel for four days and none will even notice. You can choose to attend the lecture or choose to not. None actually cares.

When you have that much free time to yourself, it can be overwhelming at times. Concretely, I remember going to bed by 11 in my first year changed to 4am or not sleeping at all by the time I came home for the 2020 holiday. I still sleep around 3 in the morning. It's not the best of things but it is what it is.

You can choose to study regularly or you can choose to not study at all. You have all these activities going on throughout the year, it can be overwhelming. You can sit all day at the cafe or in the library pretending to study in front of the blue Facebook screen.

You also have the online shops just three clicks away and may end up spending way above you can afford to. Your canteen bills can hit the roof, because after a point it becomes habitual to go to the canteen regularly even if you are not that hungry. This turns into a vicious cycle that can hurt you in every way.
