> "This essay was written by my sister as an entry to an essay writing competition. The words are kept the same as was submitted. I must say I'm proud of her xD. She's in grade 6."

The Novel Coronavirus or COVID-19 that started from China has caused lockdown all over the nation, which is an excellent matter for some people while it is a very annoying sort of thing for others. Few examples are parents of those children who donâ€™t like roaming have much assistance from the lockdown, whereas the children are the ones who are suffering from it. Another example of people who are suffering from this lockdown are the employees, officers, and labourers because they cannot go to work because of the lockdown. Whereas for us the children we cannot go to school and as most of us are probably missing our friends, teachers, loved ones, family etc. which currently I am.

So for me, this lockdown is both excellent and bad. Few "Excellent" reasons are that I'm stuck at home with my mother and brother which is something I do not do, I am often away from my mom as I'm at school whereas my brother comes to visit us once or twice in a year since he stays in Uttar Pradesh doing his college. On 7th  March, he came to visit us for a week, but as the lockdown struck many states and countries, he wasn't able to go back. "Bad" in the sense as I've mentioned before I can't meet up with my friends and teachers is because I'm stuck at home with my family.

My father is not with us for he is in our village (J.B para) with my grandparents because he travels from our village to his office at Ganganagar. After all, going from my village to his office is much closer than touring from here, which is what most people consider and I do as well. We mostly communicate with my father through either call or travelling to our village.

This pandemic is causing a lot to my family for the hours of opening the market is shorter than usual periods because we wake up at 8:00 - 9:00 AM during the quarantine which is not the regular waking hours during working days. The hours of the market opening is (9:00 AM - 2:00 PM) or sometimes 1:00 PM., so in my family, buying groceries is a complicated task due to the epidemic COVID - 19. Sometimes my mom or my brother will go to the nearby shops to purchase items or eatables still, those shops only sell items like potatoes, eggs, onions, salt, pepper, snacks etc. which we cannot survive for a long time eating, but we are somehow managing. On the days when my mom wakes up earlier than usual, she will get dressed and go to the market to purchase essential items like fruits, vegetables, snacks, milk and other necessary items.

Another point affected due to lockdown in my family is water problems because the past few weeks when my mom and I visited our village, I noticed that the water supply to our house is slow due to electricity problems for lousy weather or rains as we use significant water in our day to day activities from washing clothes, bathing, drinking etc.

The pandemic lockdown has also made me a lot far away from many people like friends, teachers etc. My friends and teachers are a crucial part of my life, so being apart from them for over weeks is awkward because being stuck with my mom and brother is strange.
