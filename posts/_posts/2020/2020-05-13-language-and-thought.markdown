Humans have the remarkable ability to adapt to their surroundings, and face tough situations. Remarkable progress have been made in academia to study the connection between human thought and the language that they use. In this article, I’ll argue for why I think that languages shapes the way we think and their implications.

We can transmit our ideas across vast regions of space and time, we can transmit knowledge across minds. We can use language to conjure up bizarre ideas in other people’s minds. For example, we can say, "Imagine someone contemplating dropping out of college to open paan shops or raising cows while thinking about how neural networks work with ENG124A lecture going on in the background." No sane person would think that on their own. But we can force them to think about it through language.

There are about 7000 languages in the world, with different alphabets, sounds, vocabularies, and structures. Among them is a language spoke by the Kuuk Thayorre people of Australia. They don’t say left and right, they speak in terms of cardinal directions – South, East, North, West etc. So, one would say something like, "The biometric attendance machine is to your Southwest or move your bag a little to the South South-West." In fact, people who speak this way are oriented very well, better than anyone thought humans could. There is also a big difference in how people think about time. An English speaker might list events from left to right, with the most recent events to the right of the older events. A Hebrew speaker would do the reverse – list the events from right to left. The Kuuk Thayorre organized time from left to right when they faced South, right to left when they faced North. But, when they were made to face East, time came towards the body.

Some languages don't have exact words for numbers. Speakers of English will be able to give exact count of things if they’re asked to, however people who don’t have exact words for numbers won’t be able to do so. Languages also differ in they divide up the color spectrum. For example, in English there is only one word for blue - 'blue'. But speakers of Russian language have to distinguish between light blue - 'goluboy' and dark blue - 'siniy'. So, when you test people to distinguish colors, Russian speakers will do much better because their language have different words for different colors.

Gender for different things also varies across languages. The Sun is feminine in German, and masculine in Spanish. The Moon is the exact opposite. This shapes up how speakers of these languages think about other things. For example. German language attributes bridges to be somewhat more feminine than masculine, so when you ask German speakers to describe a bridge they are more likely to say ‘beautiful’, ‘elegant’ etc. whereas speakers of Spanish are more likely to describe bridges as ‘tall’, ‘strong’ etc.

Languages also differ in how they describe events. For example, when someone marks a proxy attendance, in English it would be fine to say “He marked the attendance” or “the attendance was marked.” In Spanish you are more likely to say “The attendance was marked” or “the attendance marked itself.” This has conse- quences. If an English speaker saw someone marking proxies, he’s more likely to remember who did it. But, a Spanish speaker would most likely remember the incident of attendance being marked rather than the person who did it because of the language construction.

Language can have big effects – space and time orientation. Language can also have deep effects – having counting words, having number words allows us to do Mathematics taught in college. Language also helps us in making decisions about colors and grammatical genders. Language can also help us with eyewitness memory. Human language is beautiful in that we can say bizarre things on national television, at the same time it allows us to communicate effectively and take our species beyond this planet. That’s the power of language. It’s just amazing.
