<p>One of my favorite books of all time. :heart: The Fault in Our Stars will always be close to my heart partly because
it's one of those books that really bumped up my teenage love-thingy emotions. I hate the author though, he always kills
one of the protagonists in his novels. But, that's probably okay. A very wise man once told me that real life is unlike
the books and I found it to be true, so far.</p>

<p>It was tragic to read that Hazel was diagnosed with cancer few months after she had her first period. The way she narrated it was hilarious, though. The entire novel is a mix of tragic events as well as fun and romantic ones. "Pain demands to be felt", she said. I agree completely. You cannot avoid pain in life, it's supposed to be painful and hard. Human life is a suffering. Take that from a 21-year-old. We can however, control how we react after tragic events, and Hazel chose to live on!</p>

Many people fall in love and manage to find their siognificant others at various points in their lives. I would call them the lucky ones because there is a significant chunk of us who aren't that lucky. A portion of us go through terrible breakups and lose faith in the institute of love altogether. True love is keeping your promise no matter what comes your way. Like I said before, this sounds too good to be true. People will just leave you when things start getting tough. You must march on.

Over the past few years, I've noticed that life has become a series of what ifs. I found myself spending days, thinking about the different paths that my life could take. At the end, it did not matter how much I thought of events, things just happened as if they were always meant to happen that way. Too many of us burn away our days worrying about things that we don't have any control over.

Some things in life like birth, death, pain, heartbreak etc. are inevitable. No matter how hard you try, you cannot be on top of everything. This sounds like a lot coming from two teenagers, but it cannot be more accurate if you look at the bigger picture. The world is not a wish granting factory. I found myself quoting this often to friends and others in different contexts. This is very much true, you cannot get everything you want in life, because we only have one death.

I don't think I'm in love with anyone, or may be I am. I don't know. It's hard to know. I re-read the novel about 7 times, and everytime I read it I take away different things from the text. The first time I read it I wondered if it's that nice to be in love. I read it a few months back. and I was laughing at how silly kids can be. Just read the quote below, LOL. :grin:
