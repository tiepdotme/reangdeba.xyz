A resistance of $2 \Omega$ is connected across one-gap of a metre-bridge (the length of the wire is 100 cm) and an unknown resistance, greater than $2 \Omega$, is connected across the other gap. When these resistances are interchanged, the balance point shifts by 20 cm. Neglecting any corrections, the unknown resistance is <br>
(A) $3 \Omega$ (B) $4 \Omega$ (C) $5 \Omega$ (D) $6 \Omega$


In an experiment to determine the focal length ($f$) of a concave mirror by the $u-v$ method, a student places an object pin $A$ on the principal axis at a distance $x$ from the pole $P$. The student looks at the pin and its inverted image from a distance keeping his/her eye in line with $PA$. When the student shifts his/her eye towards left, the image appears to be to the right of the object pin. Then, <br>

(A) $x < f$ (B) $f< x < 2f$ (C) $x=2f$ (D) $x>2f$

Two particles of mass $m$ each are tied at the ends of a light string of length $2a$. The whole system is kept on a frictionless horizontal surface with the string held tight so that each mass is at a distance '$a$' from the centre $P$ (as shown in the figure). Now, the mid-point of the string is pulled vertically upwards with a small but constant force $F$. As a result, the particles move towards each other on the surface. The magnitude of acceleration, when the separation between them becomes $2x$, is

(A) $\frac{F}{2m} \frac{a}{\sqrt{a^2-x^2}}$ (B) $\frac{F}{2m} \frac{x}{\sqrt{a^2-x^2}}$ (C) $\frac{F}{2m} \frac{x}{a}$ (D) $\frac{F}{2m} \frac{\sqrt{a^2-x^2}}{x}$

A long hollow conducting cylinder is kept coaxially inside another long, hollow conducting cylinder of larger radius. Both the cylinders are initially electrically neutral.<br>
(A) A potential difference appears between the two cylinders when a large charge density is given to the inner cylinder<br>
(B) A potential difference appears between the two cylinders when a large charge density is given to the outer cylinder<br>
(C) No potential difference appears between the two cylinders when a uniform line charge is kept along the axis of the cylinders<br>
(D) No potential difference appears between the two cylinders when same charge density is kept along the axis of the cylinders

Consider a neutral conducting sphere. A positive point charge is placed outside the sphere. The net charge on the sphere is then, <br>
(A) negative and ditributed uniformly over the surface of the sphere<br>
(B) negative and appears only at the point on the sphere closest to the point charge<br>
(C) negative and distributed non-uniformly over the entire surface of the sphere<br>
(D) zero

A circuit is connected as shown in the figure with the switch $S$ open. When the switch is closed, the total amount of charge that flows from $Y$ to $X$ is<br>

A ray of light traveling in water is incident on its surface open to air. The angle of incidence is $\theta$, which is less than the critical angle. Then there will be<br>
(A) only a reflected ray and no refracted ray<br>
(B) only a refracted ray and no reflected ray<br>
(C) a reflected ray and a refracted ray and the angle between them would be less than $180^{\circ}-2\theta$<br>
(D) a reflected ray and a refracted ray and the angle between them would be greater than $180^{\circ}-2\theta$
