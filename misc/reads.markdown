</a><br>If you want just to read the summary of the book, I think reading only the last page would do. The book overall tells you about how the things that you thought are going on pretty well in your life is not right. It makes you realize that the little things in life matter and that everything in life is fleeting, so you must not cling to any particular item or person. If you get too much attached to a person or an item, you will suffer great pain when they leave. Overall, it's a short book. It should take you about 3 hours maximum to read the book. <br><br>If you are looking to buy a new one: don't. Although, if you are not tight on budget you can get one. Just read the last page of the book. The 10 points summary should be good enough. I took a hit for the team. You're welcome.
