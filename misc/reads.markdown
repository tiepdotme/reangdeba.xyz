I read about 150 words per minute (wpm) as per this [website](https://www.myreadspeed.com/). My personal [goal](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/21227074) for 2020 is to <mark>read 50 books</mark>. Let's see how far I can get by the end of the year. I also plan to write a summary of my readings by the end of the year.
