**Note.** I used these resources extensively while preparing for GATE CS 2021.

There are tons of resources out there that can help you in preparing for GATE, including coaching institutes, online platforms, crash courses and other online resources. **So why another guide?** For starters, all of the above costs a huge sum of money which I could not afford or let's just say I wasn't willing to spend that much for a test prep.

I had three main criteria in mind while preparing this guide:

-   All the material must be freely available. By "free" I mean completely free of cost. No trial, no ads, no bullshit!
-   The material must closely follow GATE CS syllabus.
-   The books/courses must be doable within 90 days, if you're serious.

I don't want this to be yet another list of another "200+ great online courses for GATE." This is my attempt to provide definitive answer to:

-   **Which sections** should you learn, and why?
-   What is **the best** book or video lecture to master each section?  

### TL;DR

Study all the 13 sections below, in roughly the presented order, using either the book or the courses but ideally both. Aim for about 72 hours of study for each section, and then practice lots of questions. Once you're done with that, practice previous years' papers, and you should be good to go. Come back and review the material as needed. All the best!
