**Hi!** üôÜüèª‚Äç
<br>
Thanks for coming here. This page contains a few questions on a few opinions. In my opinion, none of these have a straightforward *one size fits all* solution. Most of these are based on opinions of people that I've met during family meet-ups or social gatherings. <red>Controversial opinions upcoming! üö©</red>

### Should women be allowed to work after marriage?
**Opinion:** Women should not be allowed to work after marriage as it may hamper the marriage-bonding and weaken family ties. Women should be at home taking care of the children and upholding family traditions while performing day-to-day chores. Husband shall be the sole bread earner of the family. A women who is educated, and is on a job after marriage is likely to run off with another man, hence the wedding vows are disrespected.

I attended a wedding ceremony recently, and one of the older gentleman present there said this about the newly-wed couple. He happens to be a close relative apparently (I asked an aunty later on). I was deeply disturbed by what the man said. I even took this up with my parents and relatives at a later time. I was shocked by the number of people in the room who thought the same way. I vowed to not let my sister be the victim of that mentality even if it means leaving "the society" for good. Their arguments seemed rather naive to me. Now, don't get me wrong here, it is possible that I have a polarized view on this but I pose the following questions to you:

> I only have questions, no definitive answers. Please comment below your thoughts. Thank you very much! ü•∫

 - Are women merely creatures who carry babies and go on about doing household chores?
 - What about all the hardwork that they do, what about their ambitions?
 - Also, why is it so hard to accept the fact that it is okay if marriages don't last a lifetime?
 - Why does it have to end with one or the other dying?
 - Why would a woman run off with another man after she's married she's happy with the marriage?
 - Why should the man be insecure about the wife leaving him?
 - Should you leave someone after marriage? If yes, why?
 - Or should you try and uphold the marriage, no matter what?
 - Should a society shape itself and its people based on the existing culture or shape its culture in such a way that it changes with time and situations if need be?
 - Should one live in such a society where people are forced to live according to the existing norms?
 - How do you convince the people around you?
 - Who are they to dictate one's individual liberty? Should they? Even if they are your biological parents?
 - Should you try to convince everyone around you or try and leave the society if you can?
 - Are they completely wrong to say so?
 - Did you also come across similar opinions that your relatives had about a certain things? What are those, comment below?
 - <red>Finally, what's your opinion?</red>
