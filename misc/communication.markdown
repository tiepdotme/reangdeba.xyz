I was told by a very nice professor in one of the courses that Language is imperfect. I subscribe to that school of thought. Communication is hard, and people have different expectations from "conversations". I am blunt, and do not know what to infer from cues or expressions. Sorry!

Hence, I think it is better to let you know how to get in touch in case you are at all interested. In short:
* I am blunt, and hence you should be as straightforward as possible when trying to tell/ask me something.
* Once I start talking I almost cannot stop unless you explicitly ask me to or I run out words. **Warning**: I almost always never run out of words.
* I believe your time is valuable, so is mine. Hence, if we do not know each other very well I would prefer to-the-point conversation. Thanks!

### Email
**Email:** <code>{surname}{dot}bade{at}gmail{dot}com</code>. I think this is the best way to get in touch if we've not met before. I check my inbox everyday and try to respond to all emails. There are however, a few exceptions:
* I cannot help you get into IITs or any college for that matter. So, please do not ask about stuff that are beyond my capabilities. I am as clueless as you are. :smile:
* Anything else that I deem not worth responding to.

### Social Media
Like most kids my age, I am on social media. But these days, I've significantly reduced the time I spend on 'em. The services I use include:
* üê¶ Twitter: I open Twitter ([@reangdeba](https://twitter.com/reangdeba)) only to check Elon's tweets, and find people doing interesting stuff with Machine Learning.
* üëç Facebook: I check Facebook 2-3 times a week just to catch up with on-campus events, or have a look at Subtle Curry Traits memes. Feel free to say "hi!" if you wish to, but if you are not a friend your text might land up in a different folder that I don't usually check. My username is [@reangdeba](https://www.facebook.com/reangdeba).
* üì∏ Instagram: I am on Instagram as [@reangdeba_](https://www.instagram.com/reangdeba_/). I don't usually message people on Instagram, so I might not reply to your texts as well. But, feel free to follow if you like my posts. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
* üíº LinkedIn: I do read LinkedIn ([@reangdeba](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reangdeba/)) messages, but very rarely. How rare? umm, about once a month.
* ‚úçÔ∏è Quora: I occasionally write on Quora. I'm on Quora as [Debashish Reang](https://www.quora.com/profile/Debashish-Reang). Feel free to text.

**tl;dr**: Follow me on social media but email is best for reaching me.:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

### Meet-ups
* :coffee: You might find me at CCD if you're on campus. I love meeting up with people in real life. If you happen to be a family member or related to a family member in some way, I'll be happy to buy you coffee. I usually go there in between classes and after 6 PM on most weekdays.
* If you're not on campus, the probability of you running into me is almost zero, since I rarely go out!
* You might also find me in I307, Hall 5. But, please let me know if you plan on showing up on my doorstep.
* If you don't find me in those places, I'm probably asleep in KD Ground Floor Lab.
* <reddot>If you still don't find me I'm probably dead.</reddot>

### Calling
I don't usually talk to people over phone. Still, if you think you need to call me let me know over email first if you're not a family member. My phone is always on silent and if I miss your call chances are I won't call back. I think to myself okay, I call back after doing blah and blah but I almost always forget to do that. When I am not in class or procrastinating I work on projects that are of interest to me. That leaves me with very little free time for small talks. Sorry!

**In conclusion** don't be mad at me if I don't get back to you. I would love to have more friends in my life. If you think you are as crazy as I am we can certainly be friends. Just shoot an email, and if I act like a freak feel free to remind me that.
