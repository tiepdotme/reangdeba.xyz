* I am blunt, and hence you should be as straightforward as possible when trying to tell/ask me something.
* Once I start talking I almost cannot stop unless you explicitly ask me to or I run out words. **Warning**: I almost always never run out of words.
* I believe your time is valuable, so is mine. Hence, if we do not know each other very well I would prefer to-the-point conversation. Thanks!

### Email
**Email:** <code>hi{at}reangdeba{dot}xyz</code>. I think this is the best way to get in touch if we've not met before. I check my inbox everyday and respond to all emails. I mean it, I **reply to all**. There are however, a few exceptions:
* I cannot help you get into IITs or any college for that matter. So, please do not ask about stuff that are beyond my capabilities. I am as clueless as you are. :smile:

### Social Media

* üê¶ Twitter: I open Twitter ([@reangdeba](https://twitter.com/reangdeba)) more often than not. Say hi! I try to reply to everyone.
* üëç Facebook: I check Facebook 2-3 times a week just to catch up with on-campus events, or have a look at Subtle Curry Traits memes. Feel free to say "hi!" if you wish to, but if you are not a friend your text might land up in a different folder that I don't usually check. My username is [@reangdeba](https://www.facebook.com/reangdeba).
* üì∏ Instagram: I am on Instagram as [@reangdeba_](https://www.instagram.com/reangdeba_/). I don't usually message people on Instagram, so I might not reply to your texts as well. But, feel free to follow if you like my posts. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
* üíº LinkedIn: I do read LinkedIn ([@reangdeba](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reangdeba/)) messages, but very rarely. How rare? umm, about once a month.

**tl;dr**: Follow me on social media but email is best for reaching me.:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

### Meet-ups
* :coffee: You might find me at CCD if you're on campus. I love meeting up with people in real life. If you happen to be a family member or related to a family member in some way, I'll be happy to buy you coffee. I usually go there in between classes and after 6 PM on most weekdays.
* If you're not on campus, the probability of you running into me is almost zero, since I rarely go out!
* You might also find me in Hall 5. But, please let me know if you plan on showing up on my doorstep.
* If you don't find me in those places, I'm probably asleep in KD Ground Floor Lab.
* <reddot>If you still don't find me I'm probably dead.</reddot>

**In conclusion** don't be mad at me if I don't get back to you. I would love to have more friends in my life. If you think you are as crazy as I am we can certainly be friends. Just send me an email.
