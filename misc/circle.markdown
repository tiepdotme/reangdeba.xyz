#### Interesting Academic Papers
Collection of a few academic papers that I found "cool".

* [Super-resolving the Ising model with convolutional neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02372). The authors of this paper tried to extend convolutional neural nets or more popularly known as CNNs, to  condensed matter physics. In particular, they tried to model physical lattices using neural nets for 1D and 2D lattices, and show that the predictions are pretty close to those obtained by Monte-Carlo simulations.
