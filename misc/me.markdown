**Hi, again!** 🤷‍♂️
<br>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reangdeba_/" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/duckduck.jpg" style="float: right; max-width: 33%; margin: 0 0 1em 2em; border-radius: 50%"></a></p>

<p>He is known more commonly as Reang. Before coming to Kanpur, he was at NPS International School Guwahati where he titrated chemicals, multiplied lots of matrices, and wrote the JEE Advanced exam!</p>

Even before that, he spent the first 16 years of his life living in a small state known as [Tripura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripura), in the North Eastern part of India (look it up!). He'd chased chickens as a kid. He'd mostly lived outside of Tripura ever since. He is Indian despite his appearance.^ If you compliment him with "your English is very good", you will get the response "thanks; so is yours."

> "When life itself is lunatic, who knows where the madness lies?"

**Here are some other things of interest, in no particular:**
<br>
\* You'll (almost) always find him in black jeans and solid black t-shirt. There is no particular reason for it, he just likes it. When he really feels like switching, he switches to blue t-shirt and black jeans. 👘
<br>
\* He can sing a few songs, but you probably won't hear him singing around. 🎼
<br>
\* He loves open mics and stand up comedy. Hasan Minhaj is his favourite comedian. 🎭
<br>
\* He loves Taylor Swift's music. She is the queen, no arguments on that! 🎼
<br>
\* When not working on serious stuff, he prefers scribbling his thoughts on his iPad, writing on this blog, eat chocolates or watch a really romantic movie. 🍿
<br>
\* He loves bicycle rides. It's the best thing in the world to do. 🚴
<br>
\* He loves the smell of new books. No matter how much anyone tells him about the upside of getting an eBook, he tries to get paperbacks whenever possible. You can find his readings [here](/reads/). 📚

At times, he dances weirdly to 'Sadi Gali' and 'London Thumakda'.💃 And he loves everything that has the word 'chocolate' in it. 🍫

^ This because:
<br>
a) He'd been asked a few times if he's from China or Nepal or Bhutan.
<br>
b) This helps him appreciate the diverse world he lives in. He's grateful. 😃

Here is his [bucket](/bucket/) list. [Here](/courses/) is a list of courses that he took at IIT Kanpur.

I'm always open to interesting conversation and collaboration. If you are at IIT Kanpur and wish to meet up, coffee is on me. No questions asked. <span style="color: red">Let's have coffee?</span>☕

**What's with the emojis?**<br>
Umm, I love emojis. I think they are beautiful and can cheer people up. They also help in getting your point across better as compared to using only words to communicate. You'll find lots of 'em on this site. What's your favourite emoji? Mine is 🍫.
