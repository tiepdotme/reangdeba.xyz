**Hi!**
<br>
I am Debashish Reang. I also go by Deba and more commonly Reang. I am a third year undergraduate student running after a Bachelor of Technology degree in Electrical Engineering. I had no idea what I was signing up for initially. You can read more about it [here](/2019/11/23/lookback/). I wish to be a Professor one day. I do not know where my pursuit will take me, but I wish to be a kind human being in whatever I do.

I spent the first 16 years of my life living in a small state known as Tripura, in the North Eastern part of India (look it up!). I've mostly lived outside of Tripura ever since but I love my people, and the home food. It's the best place on earth. Come, say hi. And yes, I am Indian despite my appearances.^ If you compliment me with "your English is very good", you will get the response "thenks; so is yours" (notice 'e' not '<s>a</s>').

Outside of technology, I am passionate about improving the quality of political discourse: there is just so much unrest and disagreements in this world. Being in India makes me want to change things for good even more. I was never interested in how the world worked, and the policies that shaped it until very recently after very bad things happened to the people I love.

Here are some other things of interest, in no particular:
<br>
\* You'll (almost) always find me in black jeans and solid black t-shirt. There is no particular reason for it, I just like it. When I really feel like switching, I switch to blue t-shirt and black jeans.
<br>
\* I love memes, especially the ones that are related to tech, life of a desi, and college life.
<br>
\* I can sing a few songs, but you probably won't hear me singing around.
<br>
\* I love open mics and stand up comedy. Hasan Minhaj is my favorite comedian.
<br>
\* I love Taylor Swift's music. She is the queen, no arguments on that!
<br>
\* When not working on serious stuff, I prefer scribbling my thoughts on my iPad, writing on this blog, eat chocolates or watch a really romantic movie.
<br>
\* I love bicycle rides. It's the best thing in the world to do. We can go for a ride if you happen to be around, and I happen to be free.
<br>
I love dancing to 'Sadi Gali' and 'London Thumakda'. And I'll eat anything that contains the word chocolate in it.

^ I mention this because:
<br>
a) I've been asked a few times if I was from China or Nepal or Bhutan. I'm glad that you're curious. Happy to let you know.
<br>
b) This helps me appreciate the diverse world we live in. I'm grateful. :smile:

Here is my [bucket](/bucket/) list.
