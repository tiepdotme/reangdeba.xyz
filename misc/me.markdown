**Hi!** 🙆🏻‍
<br>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reangdeba_/" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/duckduck.jpg" style="float: right; max-width: 33%; margin: 0 0 1em 2em; border-radius: 50%"></a></p>
<p>I am Debashish Reang. I also go by Deba and more commonly Reang. I am a third year undergraduate student at IIT Kanpur majoring in Electrical Engineering ⚡. I am broadly interested in Computer Vision and Biology. I would probably end up working in the intersection of these fields. Before coming to Kanpur, I was at NPS International School Guwahati where I titrated chemicals, multiplied lots of matrices, and wrote the JEE Advanced exam!</p>

Even before that, I spent the first 16 years of my life living in a small state known as [Tripura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripura), in the North Eastern part of India (look it up!). I've mostly lived outside of Tripura ever since. Yes, I am Indian despite my appearance.^ If you compliment me with "your English is very good", you will get the response "thanks; so is yours."

**Here are some other things of interest, in no particular:**
<br>
\* You'll (almost) always find me in black jeans and solid black t-shirt. There is no particular reason for it, I just like it. When I really feel like switching, I switch to blue t-shirt and black jeans. 👘
<br>
\* I can sing a few songs, but you probably won't hear me singing around. 🎼
<br>
\* I love open mics and stand up comedy. Hasan Minhaj is my favourite comedian. 🎭
<br>
\* I love Taylor Swift's music. She is the queen, no arguments on that! 🎼
<br>
\* When not working on serious stuff, I prefer scribbling my thoughts on my iPad, writing on this blog, eat chocolates or watch a really romantic movie. 🍿
<br>
\* I love bicycle rides. It's the best thing in the world to do. We can go for a ride if you happen to be around, and I happen to be free. 🚴
<br>
\* I love reading and the smell of new books. No matter how much anyone tells me about the upside of getting an eBook, I get paperbacks when possible. You can find my readings [here](/reads/). 📚

At times I dance to 'Sadi Gali' and 'London Thumakda'.💃 And I love everything that has the word 'chocolate' in it. 🍫

^ I mention this because:
<br>
a) I've been asked a few times if I was from China or Nepal or Bhutan. I'm glad that you're curious.
<br>
b) This helps me appreciate the diverse world we live in. I'm grateful. :smile:

Here is my [bucket](/bucket/) list. [Here](/courses/) is a list of courses that I took at IIT Kanpur. I'm best reached by email. Please consider reading [communication](/communication/). <span style="color: red">Let's have coffee?</span>

### What I'm working on
1. ⚡ Finishing my degree on time, duh!
2. ✍️ I love writing. All of my writings are in [blog](/blog). I plan to populate this site with more technical and non-technical writings.

**What's with the emojis?**<br>
Umm, I love emojis. I think they are beautiful and can cheer people up. They also help in getting your point across better as compared to using only words to communicate. You'll find lots of 'em on this site. What's your favourite emoji? Mine is 🍫.
