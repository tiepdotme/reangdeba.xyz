**Here are some other things of interest, in no particular:**
<br>
\* You'll (almost) always find him in black jeans and solid black t-shirt. There is no particular reason for it, he just likes it. When he really feels like switching, he switches to blue t-shirt and black jeans. 👘
<br>
\* He can sing a few songs, but you probably won't hear him singing around. 🎼
<br>
\* He loves open mics and stand up comedy. Hasan Minhaj is his favourite comedian. 🎭
<br>
\* He loves Taylor Swift's music. She is the queen, no arguments on that! 🎼
<br>
\* When not working on serious stuff, he prefers scribbling his thoughts on his iPad, writing on this blog, eat chocolates or watch a really romantic movie. 🍿
<br>
\* He loves bicycle rides. It's the best thing in the world to do. 🚴
<br>
\* He loves the smell of new books. No matter how much anyone tells him about the upside of getting an eBook, he tries to get paperbacks whenever possible. You can find his readings [here](/reads/). 📚

At times, he dances weirdly to 'Sadi Gali' and 'London Thumakda'.💃 And he loves everything that has the word 'chocolate' in it. 🍫

^ This because:
<br>
a) He'd been asked a few times if he's from China or Nepal or Bhutan.
<br>
b) This helps him appreciate the diverse world he lives in. He's grateful. 😃

Here is his [bucket](/bucket/) list. [Here](/courses/) is a list of courses that he took at IIT Kanpur.

**What's with the emojis?**<br>
Umm, I love emojis. I think they are beautiful and can cheer people up. They also help in getting your point across better as compared to using only words to communicate. You'll find lots of 'em on this site. What's your favourite emoji? Mine is 🍫.
