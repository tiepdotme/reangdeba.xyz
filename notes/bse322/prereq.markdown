**Prerequisites:**
Although there are no strict prerequisites, the course requires some familiarity with molecular biology *(what is a gene? a protein?)* and some comfort level with probability and statistics *(what is standard deviation? a probability distribution?)*.

**A few words:**
It is suggested that you read the material in order, if you are reading it for the first time. In case you are using these notes as a reference, then feel free to skip to the appropriate section and read what you need to.

**Optional References:**
1. "Introduction to Bioinformatics Algorithms" by Neil Jones and Pavel Pevzner. 
2. "Bioinformatics" by David Mount *(2nd edition)* 

**Thanks:** We'd like to thank Prof. Nitin Gupta for the notes that he presented in class, the way he presented, and his excellent teaching style inspired us to come up with the material.

**Good luck!**
