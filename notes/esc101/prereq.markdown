**Prerequisites:**
These set of notes assumes no prior experience in programming. In fact, majority of people who take ESC101 have no background whatsoever in programming. The notes however, assume that you are willing to read the material properly, and that you know basic arithmetic and understand English. Effort is being made to *[translate](https://github.com/reangdeba.github.io/translations/)* these notes to other languages as well! Any student above grade 9+ should be able to easily grasp the material presented.

**A few words:**
It is suggested that you read the material in order, if you are reading it for the first time. In case you are using these notes as a reference, then feel free to skip to the appropriate section and read what you need to. The best way to learn is to practice coding from scratch, irrespective of how well you read the notes. A few suggested sites for practice are Geeksforgeeks, HackerRank, HackerEarth. If you are one of those *daring-types* you can practice problems from Project Euler as well.

**Setup guide:**
We would recommend compiling your code on the cloud *(read: online)*, rather than setting up the IDEs, compilers, and what not on your machine. However, if you still feel like you must then we suggest looking into Code::Blocks.

**Good luck!**
