**Pre-requisites:**
**Instructorâ€™s consent.** The course will need a strong background in linear
algebra and probability theory.

**Course Objectives:**
This course aims at introducing the students to the fundamentals of machine
learning (ML) techniques useful for various signal processing applications. It
will discuss various mathematical methods involved in ML, thereby enabling
the students to design their own models and optimize them efficiently. The
lectures will focus on mathematical principles, and there will be coding based
assignments for implementation. Prior exposure to ML is not required. The
course will be focused on applications in signal processing and communication, and the theory will be tailored towards
that end.

**Topics:**
*Total 40 classes of 50 minutes each*
* Introduction (1 class)
* Linear Algebra Refresher (2 classes)
* Programming Basics (1 class)

**References:**
This course will take excerpts from some standard books on machine learning
and signal processing. But it will largely be based on articles and research
papers in ML and SP conferences (e.g., ICASSP, NeurIPS, ICML, Interspeech, ISMIR, etc.) and journals (e.g., IEEE TASLP, JMLR, IEEE PAMI, IEEE Wireless Comm., etc.).
