"The premises of customer is 700 meter away from the splitter point and the connection being temporary in nature, it is physically and financially not viable."
lmao, bsnl (or more accurately the vendor) refused me internet connection because I refused to pay hidden charges. we were gonna be a superpower in 2020, smh. note that it's only 700 meters, not some 10 km away.
the fact of the matter is that i refused to pay up the hidden fees and wrote a letter to Telcom Ministry in New Delhi (they conducted an investigation and replied promptly, I'm impressed!). seems like i managed to hurt the ego of a few grown-ups. i mean, good for them, now I'll have to pay higher fees for Jio 4G. I guess I should've paid the hidden fees and maybe a little bribe too xD.
