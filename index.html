                    <p><strong>Hello!</strong></p>
                    <p>I am Debashish.</p>
                    <p> I am a sophomore at the <a href="https://iitk.ac.in">Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur</a>, majoring in <a href="https://iitk.ac.in/ee">Electrical Engineering</a> &ndash; expected to graduate in 2021.</p>
                    <p>I love numbers, good food, bicycle trips, chocolates (mostly not-so-dark ones) and everything that’s good.</p>
                    <p>I hold profound interests in technology, computational biology, online learning, education, society, and public speaking. I wish to end up with a Ph.D. in Computational Biology.</p>
                    <p><strong>Curious?</strong> As to why study Electrical Engineering if later on I'd be switching to Computational Biology, anyway. Let's talk about this over a cup of Chai or Coffee, what say?
                    <p>I also attended <a href="https://npsis.in">NPS International School Guwahati</a> from June 2015 until graduation in July 2017.</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>My HackerRank is <code>137117</code>. I hope I'll improve over-time. <code>C</code> is the 1st Programming Language that I was introduced to,
                        but I am in Love with <code>Python</code> now, specifically <code>Python3</code>, is kind of my language of choice.</p>

                    <p>Here is a <a href="/blog/thoughts">list of thoughts and quotes</a> that I found inspiring.</p>
