        <p>I'm Debashish Reang, a final-year undergrad at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur studying Electrical
            Engineering. I grew up chasing
            chickens in a small village in India, and playing cricket on paddy fields.
        </p>
        <p>I'm currently working with <a href="https://hamimzafar.wixsite.com/home">Prof. Hamim Zafar</a> on
            Computational Biology, alongside completing my degree on time.</p>

        <p>Previously, I worked with <a href="https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/pmalakar/">Prof. Preeti Malakar</a> in
            the Parallel Computing Lab on High Performance Computing, did an undergraduate project with <a
                href="http://home.iitk.ac.in/~vipular/">Prof. Vipul Arora</a> on Machine Learning for Physics. I also
            had a short stint as a software developer, working on <a
                href="https://www.treadwill.org/landing">treadwill.org</a>'s post recommendation system with <a
                href="https://www.iitk.ac.in/bsbe/nitin-gupta">Prof. Nitin Gupta</a>.</p>

        <p>In my free time, I <a href="/reads">read</a>, <a href="/blog">write</a> and <a
                href="https://youtube.com/channel/UCc0hAFLO1vlv208es8Yt2TQ" target="_blank">teach on YouTube</a>.
            I aim to create a beautiful corner of the web devoid of ads, sponsored products, annoying popups, and other
            annoying stuff that has become so common on the internet these days. If you love my work, please consider <a
