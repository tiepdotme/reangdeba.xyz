  <p>Hey! <br>I am a rising Junior at the <a href="https://iitk.ac.in">
    Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur</a>, pursuing <a
    href="https://iitk.ac.in/ee">Electrical Engineering</a>,
    with major interests in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. Prior to that, I graduated from NPS International 
    School Guwahati, where I spent 2 wonderful years multiplying matrices, 
    titrating chemicals, and what not!
  </p>

  <p>Apart from my compulsory coursework I like to go through classes on Coursera 
    and edX. I usually look for courses that are taught by very good instructor
  on topics related to Machine Learning or Programming principles. 
  I managed to complete three courses: <a href="https://courses.edx.org/certificates/4c43dcc19dde4cb1a860d604491357df">Programming Using Python</a>,
  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/F6RQQH5ZNWY2">Algorithms</a> & 
  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/JXCEEJMCWFP7">Neural Networks and Deep Learning</a>.
  </p>
  <p>On a side for fun I <a href="/blog/">blog (<i>mostly technical</i>)</a>, <a href="/complex">write notes</a>,
    <a href="/see/">organize events</a>, maintain <a href="https://github.com/reangdeba/">open-source projects</a>, and dream about
    checking all items on
    my <a href="/bucket/">bucket list</a>. When not working on serious stuff, I can 
    be found riding my bicycle, eating chocolates, listening to <strong>Taylor
    Swift</strong>, expressing those deep thoughts, or hanging out with friends.

  <h2>Research Interest</h2>
  <p>
    I'm broadly interested in <b>Machine Learning</b> specifically <b>Computer Vision, 
    and Natural Language Processing</b>, and my goal is to connect these two so that 
    it has meaningful real-world impact. I have also been working on <b>high performance 
    computing</b> for critical weather simulation and its visualization in real-time.
