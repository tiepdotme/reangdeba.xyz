        <p>I'm Debashish Reang, a third-year undergrad at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. I grew up chasing chickens in a small village in India, aspiring to be a pilot looking at the aeroplanes flying over me.</p>
        <p>I aspire to be a writer, computer scientist, politician, comic artist and many more. Although, I think I'll end up pursuing a PhD in one of the branches of CS.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I <a href="/reads">read</a>, <a href="/blog">write</a> and <a href="/bucket">long to travel the world</a>. Here is my  <a href="/assets/docs/DebashishReang_March_2020.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a>.</p>
        <p>I'm best reached by <a href="/communication">email</a>. I love meeting new people, and am always open to collaboration.</p>
