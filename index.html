            <p><strong>Hello! Nice to meet you.</strong></p>
            <p>I'm Debashish Reang.</p>
            <p> I am a sophomore at the <a href="https://iitk.ac.in">Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur</a>, majoring in <a href="https://iitk.ac.in/ee">Electrical Engineering</a> &ndash; expected to graduate in 2021. Prior to coming to Kanpur, I was at <a href="https://npsis.in">NPS International School Guwahati</a> from June 2015 until graduation in July 2017, where I won the 'Student of the Year' award and the 'Best Speaker against the motion' in the 5th RR Das Memorial Debate Competition. I multiplied and eliminated lots of matrices, titrated chemicals, read tons of books and gave a few talks while in high-school.</p>
            <p>I spent my childhood and most of my teenage years in a small (but lovely!) town- Ambassa <strong>(never heard of it?)</strong>. While not reading in the library, I can be found hanging out with my friends, riding bicycle, eating chocolates or talking deep philosophical <strong>(sometimes silly!)</strong> thoughts.</p>
            <p>I hold profound interests in technology, Artificial Intelligence, computational biology, online learning, education, society, and public speaking. I wish to end up as a faculty member of the practice of Computer Science, travel to many places, meet new people, and bring positive change in people's lives.</p>
            
            <p>Here is a <a href="/blog/thoughts">list of thoughts and quotes</a> that I found inspiring.</p>
            <p>Music has and probably will always be an integral part of my growing up. I am a huge fan of Taylor Swift's songs. A few of 1D's songs also resonate in my mind. That being said, I am open to listening to any form of music that does good to me and connect with me.</p>
            <p>In case you want to discuss something (new or old!) or want to meet-up somewhere, do let me know.</p>
