        <p>I'm Debashish Reang, a third-year undergrad at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. I grew up chasing chickens in a small village in India, aspiring to be a pilot looking up at the aeroplanes flying over me.</p>
        <p>I aspire to be a writer, computer scientist, comic artist and many more. Although, I think I'll end up pursuing a PhD in one of the branches of CS.</p>
        <p>I also teach on YouTube. Check out the lessons <a href="https://youtube.com/channel/UCc0hAFLO1vlv208es8Yt2TQ" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I <a href="/reads">read</a>, <a href="/blog">write</a> and <a href="/bucket">long to travel the world</a>. Here is my  <a href="/resume">resume</a>.</p>
        <p>I aim to create a beautiful corner of the web devoid of ads, sponsored products, annoying popups, and other annoying stuff that has become so common on the internet these days. If you love my work, please consider <a href="/thanks">supporting</a> me.</p>
        <p>I'm best reached by <a href="/communication">email</a>. I love meeting new people, and am always open to collaboration.</p>
