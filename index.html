            <p><strong>Hello! Nice to meet you.</strong></p>
            <p>I'm Debashish Reang.</p>
            <p> I am a sophomore at the <a href="https://iitk.ac.in">Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur</a>, majoring in <a href="https://iitk.ac.in/ee">Electrical Engineering</a> &ndash; expected to graduate in 2021.</p>
            <p>When not reading, I write, ride bicycle, and eat lots of chocolates while listening to melancholic music, EDMs, and Taylor in between. I believe that fancy dresses and owning fancy items
            do not at all portray who I am, I tend to keep it minimal and put on all-black mostly, so much so that I led my friends into 
            thinking that I own only a pair of clothing.</p>
            <p>I hold profound interests in technology, computer science, computational biology, online learning, education, society, and public speaking. I wish to end up as a faculty member of the practice of Computer Science, travel a lot, meet new people, and bring positive change in people's lives.
            <a href="https://github.com/reangdeba">Here is a list of few nerdy things that I did.</a></p>
            
            <p>I attended <a href="https://npsis.in">NPS International School Guwahati</a> from June 2015 until graduation in July 2017, where I won the 'Student of the Year' and 'Best Speaker' against the motion in the 5th RR Das Memorial Debate Competition,
            multiplied and eliminated lots of matrices, memorized the properties of the p-block and everything that comes in between.</p>
            
            <p>Here is a <a href="/blog/thoughts">list of thoughts and quotes</a> that I found inspiring.</p>
            <p>I'm always looking to meet new people, getting to know their cultures, and making friends. Do drop a message, in case you want to get in touch.</p>
