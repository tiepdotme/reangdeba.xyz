        </p>
        <p>I'm a final-year undergrad at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur studying Electrical
            Engineering. I grew up chasing
            chickens in a small village in India, and playing cricket on paddy fields.
        </p>
        <p>I aspire to be a writer, computer scientist, comic artist and many more things. Although, I think I'll end up
            pursuing a PhD in one of the branches of CS.</p>
        <p>I also upload video lessons on YouTube. Check out the lessons <a
                href="https://youtube.com/channel/UCc0hAFLO1vlv208es8Yt2TQ" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I <a href="/reads">read</a>, <a href="/blog">write</a> and <a href="/list-69">long to travel
                the world</a>.</p>
        <p>I aim to create a beautiful corner of the web devoid of ads, sponsored products, annoying popups, and other
            annoying stuff that has become so common on the internet these days. If you love my work, please consider <a
                href="/thanks">supporting</a> me.</p>
        <p>I'm best reached by <a href="/communication">email</a>. I love meeting new people, and am always open to
            collaboration.
